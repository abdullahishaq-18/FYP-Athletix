# Athletix — A Fitness Intelligence Technology

Athletix is an AI-powered fitness companion that bridges the gap between technology and human trainers by delivering personalized workouts, culturally and medically adaptive diet plans, and real-time biomechanics-aware form analysis.  
It provides an intelligent, cost-effective, and accessible fitness experience for everyone — anytime, anywhere.

## Motivation
Traditional fitness solutions either rely on costly personal trainers or generic apps that fail to adapt to individual needs.  
Athletix introduces a Virtual AI Trainer that learns from users over time — understanding their goals, limitations, and preferences — creating a truly personalized fitness journey through the integration of AI, ML, and Computer Vision.

## Key Features
- **Virtual AI Trainer (Knowledge Hub)**  
  Powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuned LLMs.  
  Answers fitness, nutrition, and recovery queries safely and accurately.  

- **Real-Time Form Analysis**  
  Uses HRNet for pose estimation and biomechanics-aware feedback.  
  Detects incorrect form to prevent injuries and improve effectiveness.  

- **Adaptive Diet Planning**  
  Generates diet plans using ML-based macro balancing and constraint optimization.  
  Supports cultural and medical restrictions (Halal, Vegan, Keto, Diabetic).  

- **Reinforcement Learning Adaptation**  
  Continuously adjusts workouts and diets based on user progress, preferences, and feedback.  

- **Progress & Tracking Dashboard**  
  Tracks calories, workouts, adherence, and progress visually for long-term motivation.
